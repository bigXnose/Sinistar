  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    This project was an effort to statistically analyze the breakdown of colors in a pack of skittles. I think this assignment really demonstrated the real word applications of statistics. <br>
    Knowing the likelihood of a color within a pack of skittles is not the most useful, but it clearly shows how the lessons of this class would be used. Learning to be able to make observations of data, compare that against others, in this case my classmates. <br>
    Then be able to draw conclusions or at least likelihood of an occurrence within a range and have percentile confidence of it. <br>
    <br>
	  The lessons in this course have far reaching assistance in my desired profession. <br>
    Having a focus in Database Administration having an understanding of the ways in which the data will likely need to be used and manipulated to be used effectively will be incredibly beneficial. <br>
    <br>
	  Being able to extrapolate data and make more informed decisions. The systems involved and how to source reliable information.<br>
    Processing and analyzing information in a very data driven environment is very beneficial to problem solve and to better, more informed decisions.<br>
    <br>
	  Overall this assignment and class has framed how to take a critical lens to information. Being able to observe and test statistical information. Also has assisted in understanding population and scope and how that potentially correlates to outcomes.<br>
    Understanding data and graphs, and having an understanding of averages and different kinds of calculations that are ever present is a definite boon.<br>
    The course work has made the presence of stats very apparent, and noticing the ways in which it influences most every business decision, as well as others.
