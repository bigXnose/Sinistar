	<P>
	I tried to segment each of the different shapes into what best fit their shape as well as having each focus on linking to a different relevant group of subjects.<br>
	Rectangles were mostly pointed at solar options and way to look into. One points to Tesla's solar roof options. A seperate one points to Unbound Solar's options for solar.<br>
	These seem like an obvious choice, because if you're interested in solar panels then an oppurtunity to purchase or find an installation seems relevant.<br>
	<br>
	For the circle shapes I tried to pick things that relatively matched their size. The Solar panel selection didn't quite fit that, but that leads to an article about cylindrical solar panels which seemed fitting. <br>
	The other two are both located in the sky segment of the image.<br>
	The entire top left is a selection and gives a link to learn more information about the sun. The sun is a pretty crucial element in utlizing solar panels. While there is not a physical presence of a sun in the image it is in a spot where it seems like the sunlgiht is radiating from. <br>
	the other circle selection over a cloud and links to information about clouds. Clouds often effect solar panels ability to generate energy.<br>
	<br>
	The polygons were used to highlight areas that had specific or strange dimensions.<br>
	The first one is the dirt road which takes a very odd shape becasue of the angle.<br>
	The second is the grass that similar to the road takes an odd form. Hopefully makes these options easier to select.<br>
	The last one is the large polygon that spans all of panels in the array behind the building and links to a resource on solar farms.<br>
